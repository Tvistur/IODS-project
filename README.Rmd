# _Introduction to Open Data Science (IODS)_ 

IODS is a MOOC platform course aiming to teach how to use open software tools and to analyse (openly available) data sets, i.e. a meeting point for statistic analysis and data science.
This course consists of structured weekly exercises on selected topics as well as a final assignemnt which will investigate one of the topics in more detail.

You are welcome to follow my progress and experiences in [my course diary](https://tvistur.github.io/IODS-project).

# About the project

IODS stands for _Introduction to Open Data Science_ - a MOOC platform course aiming to teach how to use open software tools and to analyse (openly available) data sets.

We will learn to use the following tools: **R**, **R Studio**, **R Markdown** and **GitHub** (including **GitHub Desktop**). Other resources inlude **DataCamp** and **Slack**.

The topics discussed during the course are: *Regression and model validation*, *Logistic regression*, *Clustering and classification*, *Dimensionality reduction techniques*, and *Multivariate statistical modelling*.

At the core of the course are the exercises: weekly **DataCamp** and **RStudio** exercises (including peer reviews) as well as a final assignment for which one of the topics of the course will be investigated in more detail.
